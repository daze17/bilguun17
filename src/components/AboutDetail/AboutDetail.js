                     Hello! I'm Bilguun Baasansuren, an independent front-end web developer based in Ulaanbaatar Mongolia.
                                I'm comfortable with creating UX and UI designs by using Figma or Sketch.
                                I create SPAs using React, JavaScript (or TypeScript), HTML and CSS. Also I have a basic knowledge on Node js and Express js to make a back-end programming.
                                I have a great self-learning skill, and I always intend to learn newer things.
                                Outside work I love to watch movies or serials.
