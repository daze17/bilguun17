                     Hello! I'm Bilguun Baasansuren, a front-end developer based in Ulaanbaatar Mongolia.
                                I'm comfortable with creating new UI and UX designs by using Figma.
                                With my experience, I can build Single Page Applications by using React with Gatsby or NextJS, JavaScript (or TypeScript), HTML and CSS.
                                I am adaptable and confident to work into new team, furthermore I am able to pick up new frameworks to create
                                newer things. 
                                Also, I have a basic knowledge on Node js and Express js to make a back-end programming (Still learning).
                                Personally, I believe I am great at self-learning and I always intend to learn newer things.
